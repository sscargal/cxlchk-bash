# cxlchk

# Description 
`cxlchk` can be used to confirm a system with Compute Express Link (CXL) devices is healthy and the configuration looks sane. cxlchk has two main modules:
- Collector - Collects configuration and health data from the host 
- Analyzer - Runs tests against the collected data and reports whether the test Passes or Fails. If a test fails, there should be some information to explain why.

# Help

```
Usage: ./cxlchk [optional args]

Checks for known issues with persistent memory configurations.
Run with root privilege.

Optional args:
   -A <Path to dataset>
      Specify the path to a dataset. Skips running the collector.

   -C
      Run the collector only. Skips running the analyzer.

   -c <Path to CXL executable>
      Specify the path to the CXL executable

   -h,-?
      Display this help

   -l
      List Analyzer Modules and Rules

   -m <module1, module2, ..., moduleN>
      Specify which Analyzer modules to include or exclude

   -v
      Print verbose output. Use -v, -vv, and -vvv to increase verbosity.
```

# Examples

Execute `cxlchk` which runs the Collector and Analyzer
```
$ sudo ./cxlchk
```

Only collect data from the host. Does not run the analyzer
```
$ sudo ./cxlchk -C
```

Runs the analyzer against a previously collected dataset
```
$ sudo ./cxlchk -A ./cxlchk.hostname.0113-1210
```

List the available Analyzer Modules and Rules
```
$ sudo ./cxlchk -l
